Collective Access Client
========================

This is a python client for interating with the collective access client for the Interference Archive. 

It is built as a set of bindings for the [Collective Access Web Service API](http://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Web_Service_API). The Web Service API covers a lot of endpoints and interactions, many of which we probably won't need. Therefore, this is not built to be a general purpose Collective Access API.
